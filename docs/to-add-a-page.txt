To add a new front-end page...

- use or create a folder in Web Pages (web folder)
- create an XHTML file
- create a Backing Bean
  - if page is "display only" => RequestScoped
  - if page allows editing => ViewScoped
- decide on integration into navigation concept
  - possibly define view parameter(s)
- add a nagivation rule in faces-config.xml
  - define the logical outcome that should lead to the physical view
- add/change security rules in web.xml
  - possibly add new application roles
  - provide a role mapping in glassfish-web.xml
- create BL method in BL Facade (interface & implementation)
  - if needed, create a specially designed transfer object
  - add appropriate access rules (@RolesAllowed)
  
  
How to check permissions?

- e.g. which votings can be accessed?
  - look at the Role entities that are associated with the Person entity
    that corresponds to the current user

- who may create/update votings?

- who may create votings:
  - check that current user is in the STAFF role
    (this is an application role, mapped from user groups that come from the 
    security realm)
